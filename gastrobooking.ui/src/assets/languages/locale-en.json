    "HELP AVAILABLE DESCRIPTION": "Welcome to patronage! This program will allow you to make money on others going to the pub. Here you can find restaurants and other businesses that have been included in our patronage program. You can start searching as soon as you enter your address in the 'Location' section in the 'My Details' section. Each customer who makes an order of the specified minimum amount shown next to the button can be a patron of the business. You become a patron for the pre-set period in which you earn a financial share on the company's profit. Usually this is about one week and 1% of the turnover (10 ‰ ten promile) of this business on our server. The exact period and minimal order required will be displayed on the next page 'Active'. On this first page, you see the current minimum required order only for guidance. The patron becomes the customer who will have the highest sum of orders at the end of the period. Orders of your friends' accounts are also counted if they do not apply for the same business patronage. This way you can become a patron of a restaurant on the other side of the country, just if your friends listed in the 'My Members' make bookings there. To activate a business, select a mileage search circle or other parameters, and click the 'Activate' button in the list that appears. You can apply for the patronage of any business that you intend to visit during that period. You can also activate it later when you place an order that falls into the period, and the system will automatically load it when you activate it. The large 'P' next to the activation key means that the company currently has a patron. If you do not find your favorite business here, please go to the 'Requests' section, giving its name and address, we will try to add it to us. This help continues on the next page 'Active', We wish you a happy hand when choosing and if you have any questions, please write to patron@gastro-booking.com.",

    "HELP ACTIVE DESCRIPTION": "On this page, you can see the status of your and other orders, and you can decide clearly where you will order to gain or retain patronage. The period is tinged yellow for new businesses and no color for your patronized businesses. The names are painted blue for foreign patronage businesses, no color for businesses without a patron and green for your patronage. In the first column, the minimum required amount of the order is indicated. The amount of the order overtaking amount in the second column is shown only for businesses with a patron, where the minimum has already been reached, and in the third column you can see orders for an existing foreign patron. In addition, the table shows the sums of your orders in that period, the highest foreign completed order you have to overcome, and the last column showing the exact value for obtaining or retaining the patronage of the business. Your orders include your friends' orders from the 'My Members' list, which can then be  used to overcome an existing patron, as it means making orders in a higher volume, usually 10 times more. This is the benefit of a patron and of course you too if you become a patron, as then you only need to keep up the minimum orders in the given period and watch if someone does not want you down. If the amount of the order is exceeded and you can not make more orders anymore, then you lose your patronage for the next period, but your current profit will remain. So if your patronized business goes in a battle, you do not have to despair, because you will have a big profit out of orders made in this way, and you can get it again in later periods.",
